osgRecipes
=============

The osgRecipes project includes different recipes written with OpenSceneGraph (OSG) and can help developers work with this famous 3D rendering engine, as well as other auxiliary libraries. The osgRecipes project itself is in the Public Domain, but some of its recipes may be under other licenses.

This project is also the source code repository of Rui Wang & Xuelei Qian's book `OpenSceneGraph 3.0 Cookbook`, Packt Publishing, 2012. You may read more details or order this book at:

Installation
------------

1. Use CMake (or cmake-gui) to build makefiles or solutions of the recipes
# cmake <recipe_dir> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_dir>

2. Run 'make' to build and install all recipes
# make
# make install

4. Copy all files in the data directory to 'bin' in the installed directory
# cp <recipe_dir>/cookbook/data/*.* <install_dir>/bin

5. Have fun!

You may have to download and compile these third-party dependencies to test all the recipes:
